# Personal-Portfolio
This project involves building a portfolio website: first with basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, featuring animations and mobile-friendly design. It progresses to migrating to a React project with Next.js for enhanced functionality and cloud deployment. AI technologies using Microsoft Azure OPEN AI add interactive elements.
